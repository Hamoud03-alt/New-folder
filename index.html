            <p> My name is Yusuf Abdullah Olamide , I was born on the 3rd of December ,2004 . I was brought up in Qatar where I lived with my parents . I then moved to Nigeria few years back where I completed my high school . Well I speak different languages . Among is English , Arabic , Yoruba et cetera .
                I tend to see positivity in every aspect of life no matter how bad it might be. I also like to meet new people and fraternize with them , although I might come off very shy and individualistic but as time passes I loosen up and make myself feel as comfortable as possible. I am a person of principle and I have no issues distinguishing between what’s right and what’s wrong!. 
                I might not be the best but I’m trying my best and I have belief in my abilities 
                I have solid interest in a few subjects . Subjects like biology , civic education , iRS , Geography , commerce and computer studies . These particular subjects picked my interest because of tge distinct values they hold in our everyday lifestyle . 
                I  would like to become one of the most knowledgeable people in tech one day . I find comfort in engaging in computer technology related stuff even if I dint know what it is that I am doing 
                My ultimate aim is to develop a very specific technology of my own.
