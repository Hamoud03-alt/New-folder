            <p>My name is Yusuf Abdullah Olamide, born on 03/12/2004—I am a proud Muslim who lives happily under the custody of my wonderful parents.
            I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. There are many things I like to do and to experience. One thing about me that is important to know though is that at first, I come off as a very shy individualistic guy but once I get to know people and am comfortable with my environment I am great. It is hard forme to make friends but once I make them, it’s great and I am all different.I have a very tough shell but inside, i am soft. I am a very principled person who stands on what is right and what is wrong.
            
            Academically, i strive to achieve my best and become the best even though i am not the best.I stand on the right part of myself and belief in my abilities. I have a very concrete intrest in some subjets like Biology, Civic Education, Islamic Studies, Commerce, Computer Science and Geography.
            I developed a good intrest in these subjects just bcos of the value the hold in our lives.
            
            I also develop interest in the Tech World, i am very ambitious to be one of the Gurus in the Tech World. Love to engage myself in computer stuffs and love exploring the Tech videos. And watch some inventions of the old Techs and try to develop my own Technology.One of my Aim is to develop my own Tech
